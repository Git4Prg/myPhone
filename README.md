This App - myPhone is developed as a practice project to implement my learnings of kotlin and as an assignment given to me by Surefy Technologies.
The following features has been implemented :-
  1. Incoming Call Management: Display incoming calls and allow users to accept or reject them.
  2. Outgoing Call Management: Enable users to initiate and make outgoing calls.
  3. Contacts: Display and manage a list of contacts. When the user clicks on a contact from the contact list, a call will be placed

I failed to make this app as the default dialer due to which it is unable to record call logs. 

Here's a link to the google drive to download the APK file - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oHLl9zU_mmre2K9sjWMKhyh4ktLTJnM1/view?usp=sharing
